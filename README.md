# contacts-manager
Simple contact manager app with image upload capability to an Amazon S3 bucket (Multer js).
Backend was made with Express and Mongo (hosted in MongoDB Atlas cloud) and the front-end was coded with React (navigation with React-Router). 
The application state was managed with the Context API and reducer functions. Authentication handled by JWT and of course, front and back validation of data.
